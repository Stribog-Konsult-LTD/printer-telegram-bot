# Printer telegram bot
For printing just attach pdf document to telegram bot.
I am using singleboard computer for home automation. The computer runs on debian and has installed drivers for printer.
I use this bot to print documents from phone, or ouside of home. Just need to create a bot and fillup configuration file.
