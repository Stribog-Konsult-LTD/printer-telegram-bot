# Printer telegram bot
For printing, just attach pdf document to telegram bot.<br>
I am using singleboard computer for home automation. The computer runs on debian and has installed printer drivers. The bot uses default printer.
I use this bot to print documents from phone, or ouside of home. <br>
Just need to create a Telegram bot and execute `printer_bot.sh`
