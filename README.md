# Printer telegram bot
For printing, just attach pdf document to telegram bot.<br>
I am using singleboard computer for home automation. The computer runs on debian and has installed printer drivers. The bot uses default printer and prints only files attached from Master.  Master can be Telegram group.
I use this bot to print documents from phone, or ouside of home. With [Notebloc](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notebloc.app) it is easy document copier.<br>
Just need to create a Telegram bot and execute `printer_bot.sh`
